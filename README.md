# MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IMPLEMENTATION

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: BABISHA.T S

*INTERN ID*: CT04DF2712

*DOMAIN*: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

*DESCRIPTION*:
     In this task, a machine learning model was created using the Decision Tree Classifier from the scikit-learn library. The model was trained on the Iris dataset, which         contains features of flowers like sepal length, petal width, etc. The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model. After training, the model       achieved 100% accuracy, and a detailed classification report was generated showing precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

*Tools Used*:

  Language: Python

  Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib (optional for visuals)

*OUTPUT*:
